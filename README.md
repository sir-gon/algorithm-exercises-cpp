## TL;DR

Algorithms Exercises solved in [C++17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/17),
running with [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) testing suite throug [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
Developed with TDD.

## What is this?

This repository is part of a series that share and solve the same [objectives](#objetives),
with the difference that each one is based on a different software ecosystem,
depending on the chosen programming language:

- [Modern Javascript: algorithm-exercises-js](https://github.com/sir-gon/algorithm-exercises-js)
- [Python 3.x: algorithm-exercises-py](https://github.com/sir-gon/algorithm-exercises-py)
- [Typescript: algorithm-exercises-cpp](https://github.com/sir-gon/algorithm-exercises-cpp)
- [Go / Golang: algorithm-exercises-go](https://github.com/sir-gon/algorithm-exercises-go)
- [Java: algorithm-exercises-java](https://github.com/sir-gon/algorithm-exercises-java)
- [.NET / C#: algorithm-exercises-cpp](https://github.com/sir-gon/algorithm-exercises-cpp)

## Objetives

### Functional

- For academic purposes, it is an backup of some algorithm exercises
(with their solutions), proposed by various sources:
[leetcode, hackerrank, projecteuler](#algorithm-excersices-sources), ...

- The solutions must be written on "vanilla code", that is,
avoiding as much as possible the use of external libraries (in runtime).

- Adoption of methodology and good practices.
Each exercise is implemented as a unit test set,
using TDD (Test-driven Development) and Clean Code ideas.

### Disclaimer. Why I publish solutions?

As Project Euler says:

<https://projecteuler.net/about#publish>

```text
I learned so much solving problem XXX, so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?
It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, that will rarely be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.

However, the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere.
```
